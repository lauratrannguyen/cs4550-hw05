Please fill in answers to the questions below:


1. What's your name?
Laura Nguyen

2. What hostname did you deploy to?
lauratrannguyen.com

3. Which parts of this assignment did you have trouble with, if any?
Literally all of the elixir code for game.ex. No joke, it seriously made me question my CS major. I lost half my life span. However, I am deeply thankful for Prof Tuck for having a good scratch repo for the socket and game channel - I had little difficulty with that.

But still, javascript > elixir any day

4. What part of your application state is on the server?
To the server, I moved making the random secret, creating the view for the user, checking whether a guess was valid and its evaluated result, 
Checking if the game was over, displaying any error messages user inputs brought, and ending the game when attempts reached 0.

5. What part of your application state, if any, is in the browser?
I guess adding the userâ€™s guesses and results into a list, but I did connect it to the socket with ch functions for the service side to utilize them. The key press is still in the browser, as is the button clicking.
